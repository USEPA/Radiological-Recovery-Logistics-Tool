The RRLT is a computer application that organizes information on equipment and assets that may be used to recover from a wide area release of
radioactivity into the urban environment. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) National Urban Security
Technology Laboratory (NUSTL) funded Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) to build this Radiological Recovery Logistics Tool (RRLT, also “the Tool”),
which contains a database of common and specialty equipment available through local public works departments or commercial vendors. Developed in
partnership with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the RRLT provides the user
several approaches to understanding what types of equipment might be available to accomplish general and specific recovery mission activities, including
mitigating doses to responders and recovery teams, surveying and monitoring the affected area during the recovery phase, decontaminating surfaces,
handling and treating solid and liquid waste, and identifying issues related to critical infrastructure operations.

The RRLT database includes detailed information on the equipment’s everyday function, its effectiveness on different surfaces and forms of radioactive
contaminants, the scale for which the equipment may be applied, the skill required of the operator, utility requirements, legal and environmental
considerations, regional and local availability, waste generated, and cost. Other factors the Tool considers include prior uses in radiological environments,
safety measures, and best practice guidance to ensure its effective use. Ultimately, a component of the Tool’s software called the “equipment
recommendation wizard” uses artificial intelligence (AI) to create output that lists and recommends equipment that could be used to help plan recovery
operations. The Tool may be used in concert with applications previously developed by the EPA and DHS for radiological and nuclear response and
recovery [e.g., the Rad Decon Tool within RadResponder (https://www.radresponder.net/app/index), the Waste Estimation Support Tool
(https://www.epa.gov/emergency-response-research/waste-estimation-support-tool-west), as well as with prior international publications [e.g., the UK
Recovery Handbooks for Radiation Incidents (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-recovery-handbooks-for-radiation-incidents-2015) and the
Generic handbook for assisting in the management of contaminated inhabited areas in Europe following a radiological emergency (https://euneris.
net/library/handbooks/58-euranos-inhabited-areas-handbook-version-2/file.html)]. The equipment recommendation wizard is an autonomous software
agent—a unit of artificial intelligence software that chooses actions based on its goals and percepts. The goal of this agent is to expedite the user’s arrival
at a complete equipment list addressing the scenarios and conditions at hand.

A user guide is included as part of the GitHub Release.  

In collaboration with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science & Technology Directorate (S&T) has tasked Argonne National Laboratory to build and test a tool that can be used during the response and recovery from a radiological or nuclear incident to effectively identify appropriate commercial and public works equipment to mitigate, remove, and contain contamination. This tool was developed under support from the US DHS S&T under IAA No. 70RSAT18KPM000188. Any opinions contained herein are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of DHS S&T. This tool is developed by Argonne's National Security Information Systems Team:
